## Overview


### The challenge

The challenge consisted in building a recipe page while focusing on writing semantic HTML and ensuring that you would have to think through what HTML elements are most appropriate for each piece of content.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project, I learned that the usage of @media leads the design to another, since it provides conditions to adapt the design according to the device where its running, and also that sometimes it is better use the img element instead of a div with background image, even though it provides a flexibility when managing it.

In general, it was a great learning experience about the most basic of design screen adaptation and I'll love to learn more about it in the next challenges.

### Continued development

This method to adapt the page design is something that I'm willing to learn more about, since it provides a flexibility to your main design, and I want to improve on making the code leaner and more precise instead of taking alternatives.

### Useful resources
